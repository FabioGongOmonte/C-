# SetGen-Python [https://setgen.onrender.com/]

## Description
SetGen-Python is a fully functional full-stack project written in Python that allows users to generate setlists for a given show or showcase in order to minimize the number of dancers that have consecutive performances. It utilizes an SQL database and a custom REST API built with Flask. Users can log in to different shows to access their corresponding setlists.

## Key Features
- User validation and error messages for input validation failures (e.g., empty song name, insufficient dancers).
- Client-side input validation using JavaScript to provide real-time feedback on length, format, and other requirements.
- Responsive web design techniques, including media queries and flexible layouts, for a seamless experience on desktop and mobile devices.
- Refined user interface elements, such as typography, color scheme, and overall visual design, to enhance aesthetics and usability.
- Database implementation to store songs, dancers, and setlists, ensuring data persistence even after server restarts.
- User authentication and authorization mechanisms to provide personalized setlists and secure data access.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: A Python web framework used to build the REST API and handle server-side logic.
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Front-end technologies used for building the user interface and client-side validation.
- SQL: Database management system for storing and retrieving data.

Thank you for checking out SetGen-Python! We hope you find it helpful in generating optimized setlists for your shows.

## The next step ?

- Add an edit feature to be able to edit songs and dancers within the database.
- Add an export feature that would allow users to export setlists into an Excel file.
